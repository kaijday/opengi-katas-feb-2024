# ADR 5: Use Kubernetes to Deploy and Run Microservices
Date: 29/02/2024

## Status
Adopted

## Context
We need to choose a mechanism for deploying and running micro services. It needs to be highly scalable, easy to deploy to and performant.

## Decision
We will use Kubernetes to deploy, run and orchestrate our micro services.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Easy to deploy to
- Can configure deployment to be zero downtime
- Can route internal traffic without calls over the web, for performance
- Easy to auto-scale to meet traffic demands

### Negative
- Increased complexity to set-up the cluster
- Increased overhead in managing and maintaining the cluster
- Experience required and training overhead if not familiar with Kubernetes

## Alternatives Considered
- App Services
- Serverless functions
